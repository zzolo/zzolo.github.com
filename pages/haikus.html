<p>In 2009, I started the year with the thought that I would a take a self-portrait and write a haiku everyday.  I did not make it more than a month, but the short time was enjoyable and I produced some decent work.</p>

<div class="haiku-container">
  {% for haiku in site.data.haikus %}
  <article class="haiku">
    <time datetime="{{ haiku.date }}" class="haiku-date">{{ haiku.date  | date: "%A, %B %e, %Y" }}</time>

    <h1 class="h3">{{ haiku.title }}</h1>

    <p>{{ haiku.haiku | newline_to_br }}</p>

    <a href="/projects/portrait_and_haiku/images/{{ haiku.portrait }}">
      <img src="/projects/portrait_and_haiku/images/{{ haiku.portrait }}" />
    </a>

    <p><small>{{ haiku.description }}</small></p>
  </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
