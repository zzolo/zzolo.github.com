  <p>In 2009, I started the year with the thought that I would a take a self-portrait and write a haiku everyday.  I did not make it more than a month, but the short time was enjoyable and I produced some decent work.</p>

  <div id="haikus-container"></div>
</div>

{% raw %}
<script type="text/template" id="template-haikus">
  {{#(haikus === undefined)}}
    <div class="loading">
      <i class="fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>
    </div>
  {{/()}}

  {{#haikus:i}}
    <div class="haiku">
      <div class="haiku-date">{{ date.format('dddd, MMMM Do YYYY') }}</div>
      <h3>{{ title }}</h3>
      <p>{{{ haiku }}}</p>
      <img src="{{ portrait }}">
      <p>{{ description }}<p>
    </div>
  {{/haikus}}

</script>
{% endraw %}
