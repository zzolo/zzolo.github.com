Life is like the Heinsenberg uncertainty principle, which basically says: \"You cannot measure/observe something without changing that which you are measuring/observing.\"  Life is only now, affected by the past and the future, but there is no such thing as now.  We are in constant motion.  It is comforting and a bit scary to know that I cannot stop things enough to actually see it as it is.
