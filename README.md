Main site for Alan Pala*zzolo*.  See [zzolo.org](//zzolo.org).

## Development

The site is built with Jekyll and using only options that Github Pages will run.

The site has the `baseurl` option set so that links, images, etc can be made absolute for things like feeds.  This means, to run locally, you should run like: `jekyll serve --baseurl="" -w`
