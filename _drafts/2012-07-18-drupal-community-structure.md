The Drupal community is a large, vibrant, positive, and awesome group of people.  I have grown so much personally and professionally by being involved with Drupal.  And even though my time devoted to Drupal has significantly decreased, I still care about the community a great deal and want to see it grow and succeed even more.  I recently came across this great article by David Eaves about the [negative impacts of struturelessness in open communities](http://eaves.ca/2009/07/06/structurelessness-feminism-and-open/) which was inspised by Jo Freeman's [The Tyranny of Structurelessness](http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/structurelessness.html).  These articles really helped me realize my thoughts around some of my frustrations with the Drupal community, the main thing being the lack of governance (or rather the lack of documented governance).

For the past few years I have talked to many people in the Drupal community about the idea of governance, and most people shun away from wanting a governance structure for the community and some how the word "doacracy" gets stated.  Most people think of the idea of government getting in the way or creating beaucratic structures that slow down innovation and improvement, and these are the usual reasons I have heard as to why Drupal doesn't need (any more) governance.  Admittedly I am fairly radical in wanting a full-blown democratic system for the Drupal community, even to the point that the idea of a Benevolent Dictator for Life is absurd (we don't stand for it in other parts of our lives), and that we should vote for our leader(s) (I would be the first to vote for Dries).  

Structureless

I am happy to say, for the sake of this discussion, that we don't need to change or create any new governance structures for the Drupal community.  So, we are left with a few things that define the Drupal community government: the idea of "doacracy" (which I can't find where it is written down that this is how Drupal works, not what it actually means), the Drupal Code of Conduct, and very new Governance issue queue, the Drupal Association's connection with the Drupal community, and rfay's [recent governance articles](http://randyfay.com/topics/governance).  The closest thing to an official document is the Drupal Code of Conduct, which really does not cover the idea of how we govern ourselves; leading me to call the Drupal community fairly structureless.

I think the idea that the Drupal community is structureless can be confirmed by anyone in the Drupal community the first time they wanted to get something done outside of posting an issue or patch to a module.
