On **May 11th, 2011**, the [Portland Drupal User Group](http://groups.drupal.org/portland) will be holding the first ever [Drupal User Group Code Sprint](http://groups.drupal.org/node/144359)!  The second ever anywhere, actually, as the first was at [DrupalCon Chicago](http://chicago2011.drupal.org/forum/code-review-sprint-friday).  I happen to be in town that day, and am excited to help the great Drupalers review some code.

### What is a Code Review Sprint? ###

Well, that's a great question.  Since it is a new kind of event, its still being defined, but the overall goal is to get people together (hopefully at the same physical location) to review each other's code, specifically for the [Full Project Application queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/projectapplications).

### What's it Good for? ###

Well, on a very basic level, it gets the Full Application Queue worked through which is way back-logged.  But more importantly, it helps build community and stronger coding and contributions.  Funny Monkey does a great job of describing the [awesomenesss of code/peer review](http://funnymonkey.com/community-development-and-code-reviews).

### Who Should Be There? ###

A Code Review Sprint is not just about reviewers.  It's about the applicants, documenters, team builders, etc.  Come if you want to do the following (or learn how to do the following):

* Review applications (read the [how-to](http://drupal.org/node/894256) in order to get started now).
* You have an application in (or you already have a project in a sandbox).
* Help make documentation better for reviewers and applicants.  A flowchart would be stellar.
* Grow the [Code Review Team](http://groups.drupal.org/code-review).

###  You can Participate Too! ###

Even if you aren't in the Portland area, come help virtually via IRC.  There is not a Code Review channel (yet), so just meet up in the `#drupal-contribute` IRC channel.

### The Long Term ###

The Full Project Application process has had many debates.  The queue is back-logged, even after the move to Git and the use of useful sandboxes.  There are disagreements on what the goals and objectives of reviews should be, or even if we should have them at all.  I have recently started the [Code Review group](http://groups.drupal.org/code-review) to help build a community around this and create a structure place to have these important discussions, so stop on by and let us know what you think!

### Have One of Your Own ###

You can have a sprint of your own too.  It can be a part of your User Group, or you could have a whole day dedicated to it.  I have start on a [how to hold a Code Review sprint](http://groups.drupal.org/node/142499), that should get you started.
