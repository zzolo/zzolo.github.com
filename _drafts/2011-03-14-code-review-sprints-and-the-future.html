title: Code Review Sprints and the Future

Last week was the awesome DrupalCon Chicago, a week full of Drupal in all its forms, ranging from code sprints, BoF discussions, Drupal Core conversations, talks in the hallways, heated discussions over drinks, and so much more.  As part of the sprinting on Friday, I led a Code Review Sprint, which was focusing on the Full Project Access Application queue.

Though the numbers aren't huge, it was really successful and fun.  We had people to do reviews and people who needed reviews.  We even had a number of reviews done in person!  We saw people who got reviews done, stick around to do reviews for other people.  It was great!

There were some challenges though.  I think one of the biggest barriers to entry is that people think they need to be expert developers to review these applications, and that just isn't true.  In theory, if you have been approved before, you should be able to review new applications; but in reality, all you need to know is Drupal's best practices, coding standards, and security practices.

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>

So, now what?  The queue is still huge, even with the new sandboxes (which are awesome).  I would like to do the following in the next few months to get code reviewing more into how we operate as a community and to get the queue worked through.

<ul>
<li>I would like to see a more formalized structure for Code Reviewing (not just full project applications).  I think the Docs Team is very successful because there is an obvious team and leads for that team.  Though I may be the most likely lead on this, I don't need to be in this position.</li>
<li>I would like to catch up with and hopefully help with the qa.drupal.org (automated testing) team in getting some sort of automated reviewing for sandboxes.  I know there is some work being done on this at the moment, but I need more information.</li>
<li>Formalize where discussions happen around this area.  There are currently the Code Review groups and the Peer Review group.  These should be combined.</li>
<li>Create a How-To for Code Review Sprints.  These kind of sprints should be done all over the place.  User groups are really great for this since there are usually a nice range of expertise in the room.</li>
<li>Start some discussions on how to create a stronger culture in Drupal around perr reviewing each other's code, specifically in the full project application queue.</li>
<li>Think about renaming "Full Project Applications" to "Release Access", or some how making the title more accessible.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
