Today is [Systems Administrator Day](http://www.sysadminday.com/ "Sys Admin Day"). What have you done for your SysAdmin today? I bought mine two semi-fresh donuts and said "Thanks, SysAdmin". Some suggestions would be a hug and a kiss, cause I doubt they get too many. Any sort of pastry or cake would probably be very appreciated. Maybe just a good ole pat on the back. They do so much for us. It's time to give back, if just for day.
