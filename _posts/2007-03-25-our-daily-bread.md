Cole, Andy, Devon, and I saw [Our Daily Bread](http://www.ourdailybread.at/ "Our Daily Bread by Nikolaus Geyrhalter and Wolfgang Widerhofer") at the [Walker](http://www.walkerart.org/ "Walker Art Center") today. It's a compelling film by Nikolaus Geyrhalter and Wolfgang Widerhofer that gives a brilliant picture of modern food production. Watch some trailers of Our Daily Bread by Nikolaus Geyrhalter and Wolfgang Widerhofer.

Our Daily Bread is a documentary with no narration or interviews, just the sounds and sights of the factories, fields, and mines where our food is produced. The film is beautiful.

Nikolaus Geyrhalter and Wolfgang Widerhofer aim to give an unbiased look at these places. Even being so objective, the imagery is very affective and is not for the weak-stomached. I love this. I think it is imperative for our society to learn where all of our products originate from. We are so detached from our consumption, even in the food we eat. Only with knowledge, can there be change.
