Saturday I had the pleasure of venturing to [Taylors Falls](http://www.taylorsfalls.com/taylorsfalls.html "Taylors Falls") which is located on the [Saint Croix River](http://www.saintcroixriver.com/ "Saint Croix Valley") which is about an hour north of the Twin Cities. We took a small hike along the river which actually featured some contour and ridges which are hard to find in this flat land we call Minnesota. The river was exceptionally high and the "falls" were more rapids. The sign even put the word "falls" in quotations. It was beautiful and so fullfilling to get outside these grasping cities. Thanks Erika.

Before we arrived in Taylors Falls, we stopped at the [Franconia Sculpture Park](http://www.franconia.org/ "Franconia Sculpture Park") which was amazing. It seemed almost like a makeshift junk yard, but in a beautiful, intended way. I am not much of an art critic but I was very pleased.

I have posted some pictures that Tim took [here](http://www.alanpalazzolo.com/gallery/v/2006/taylorsfalls/). (There are a few pictures of Scott Baio (Charlie), who is Tim's cute, little dog).
