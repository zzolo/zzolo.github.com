So, I was looking around the "internet" for some design inspiration. It seems to be an area I lack. I do appreciate simple, but those [Flash](http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer "Macromedia Flash") sites still amaze me.

Anywho, I stumbled upon [Killer Spin](http://www.killerspin.com/ "Killer Spin"), a cumbersome Flash site dedicated to "Table Tennis". To those of us not in the know, that is "Ping Pong". It knocked me out of my chair a little. There are some really nice Flash sites that are usually highly artistic or geared towards marketing some young segment, but Ping Pong. Who knew.
