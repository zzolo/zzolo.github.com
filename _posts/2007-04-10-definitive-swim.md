Kate hit me up with this sweet deal, [Definitive Swim](http://www.adultswim.com/williams/music/defswim/ "Definitive Swim") (careful the loud music will get ya). It is a compilation of great hip hop artists brought together by [Adult Swim](http://www.adultswim.com/ "Adult Swim") and [Definitive Jux](http://www.definitivejux.net/ "Definitive Jux"). Unfortunately Old Spice has a blatant hand in it as well. Check it out cause it's free; there's a link to get the whole thing zipped up at the bottom. The compilation includes such great acts as: [Aesop Rock](http://wwww.aesoprock.net/ "Aesop Rock"), [Mr Lif](http://www.mrlif.com/ "Mr Lif"), [Cage](http://www.cagekennylz.com/ "Cage"), [El-P](http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/el-p/ "El-P"), [Camu Tao](http://www.definitivejux.net/jukies/camutao/ "Camu Tao"), and more.
