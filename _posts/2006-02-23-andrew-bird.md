So I went to go see [Andrew Bird](http://www.andrewbird.net/ "Andrew Bird") at the [Fine Line](http://www.finelinemusic.com/ "Fine Line") this evening. I do not want to be vulgar in such a public space, but I also do not beleive in censoring my words especially because of meaning; and it really is appropriate here. Andrew Bird was fucking brilliant. The man is just simply amazing. I have seen a lot of music preformed in my time, but Andrew Bird is a Jimi Hendrix of the violin, composes a song like Mozart, and whistles like no other. (For lack of a better comparison.) He is a musical genius. As Imeogen would like to say, jellybeans. So, if you get the chance to see him perform, go! Or if you can get your grubby little hands on one of his albums, slap on those headphones.
