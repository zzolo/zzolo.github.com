If you [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") the word ["failure"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=failure&btnG=Search "Google: failure"), the first match is very interesting. I will let you do it yourself. This is very interesting and presents the great question of how this happened.

Being a web developer, I immediately searched for the word "failure" in the document but to no avail. Then why and how would this happen? I thought [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") may have "hard-wired" this into its internet search functionality. I also thought briefly that there was just an enormous amounts of [back links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Links "Wikipedia: Back Links") to this page in the context of "failure". I wanted to believe [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") purposefully had done this.

If you go farther into the search results you will find this [article](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html "Google Blog Google Bombing") on how it happened. It involves the "back links". What happened is a process known as [Google Bombing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb "Wikipedia: Google Bombing").

Overall you should respect [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") for stickin' to their guns. Also, you should be proud of the great people that have made this happen and how much it says as a statement.

I have to do my part as well, so I will make a link to the [number one failure page](http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html "This man is a complete, miserable failure and puts our country to shame.").
