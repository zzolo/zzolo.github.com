[Tile Compare](http://maps.zzolo.org/tile-compare/) is a simple interface for comparing tile sets. By providing a view into all tile sets at once (instead of a layered approach), it becomes easier to understand the difference.

Currently, it shows tiles from Google, Bing, Yahoo, and OpenStreetMap, with the ability to switch to their Satellite imagery as well.  You can get the code on [my Github account](https://github.com/zzolo/tile-compare).
