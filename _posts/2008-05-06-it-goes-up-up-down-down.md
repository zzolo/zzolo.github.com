This is **My Love for You** by [ESG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG_%28band%29 "Wikipedia: ESG (Band)") from the album [A South Bronx Story](http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/releases/?id=184 "Soul Jazz Records release: A South Bronx Story").

Caitlin had this song stuck in her head the whole time we were in Belize, and thus I had it stuck in my head the whole time we were in Belize.
