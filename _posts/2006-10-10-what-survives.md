What Survives

Written by Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926)  
Translated by A. Poulin

Who says that all must vanish?  
Who knows, perhaps the flight  
of the bird you wound remains,  
and perhaps flowers survive  
caresses in us, in their ground.

It isn't the gesture that lasts,  
but it dresses you again in gold  
armor -from breast to knees-  
and the battle was so pure  
an Angel wears it after you.
