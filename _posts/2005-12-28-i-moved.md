Well, I moved almost two months ago. I now live in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is cold. It is so very cold. No complaints really. So, I got a really great job at [Minneapolis College of Art and Design](http://www.mcad.edu/ "Minneapolis College of Art and Design"). I hope everyone is having a great end-of-year celebrations.
