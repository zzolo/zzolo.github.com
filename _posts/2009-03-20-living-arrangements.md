Last night, I went to the [Uptown Theater](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/Market/Minneapolis/UptownTheatre.htm) to see the world premiere of [Living Arrangements](http://livingarrangementsmovie.com/), a horror-centric comedy about a vegan couple that has to deal with a werewolf in their attic, directed by my friend Sam Thompson.  It is hilarious!

If you missed the world premiere, I am really sorry.  It was quite the experience.  Even if it gets played in a theater again (and it hopefully will and should), it will not have the energy of the local community that helped create it and the people that care about them.  The movie was fantastic, but the movie premiere experience was even better.  My favorite part was the secret raffle prize, a DVD player that only played [Jason X](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211443/) (I did not win, but a great flick if you get the chance).
