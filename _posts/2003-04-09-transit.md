The tracks run north to sipping sun  
and south to highway gas that rises  
off hot concrete. It lulls you some,

you think, as heat escapes, it tries  
to catch the trees ablaze. You chose  
the tracks because the tracks will cry

no one and freedom, but the roads  
are full of watchful eyes. Your arms  
won’t reach the sky, you still will boast

they take to water like a torn  
paper airplane. The wind from west  
and wicked oceans straighten worn

and worried hair. You spin, you twist  
from plank to nail. Sun sets on cheeks  
with frantic blood and wilted wisps

of bashful breeze. You left, still weeks  
from home. You’re finished, dried, uncooked  
with feet ablaze, you cried for weak

you screamed. The train screams past; air shakes;  
you walk; your ready heart unshook.
