Some of you may remember when [Wikipedia and others went dark in protest of the SOPA and PIPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA).  This was a huge movement that was (probably) the main reason why those bills did not get passed.  It was also the first time that such a number of large websites protested in unison in such a significant way; a very monumental occasion for the Internet.  Unfortunately, there are still many freedoms to protect and legislation to speak up against.

<h3>Be a Superhero!</h3>

But, you can help out!  Today, the [Internet Defense League](http://internetdefenseleague.org/) launches to help make the tactics described above into a real call to action across the world on any website.  "Think of it like the internet's Emergency Broadcast System, or its bat signal!"

<h3>Do you have a Drupal site?</h3>

Well, if you do, all you have to do is install the [new Internet Defense League module](https://drupal.org/project/internet_defense_league) and when the League needs you, your site will be called upon to help protect the freedoms we enjoy so much on the Internet.

<h3>I believe in this</h3>

I care about our freedoms, especially on the Internet, and will often throw some Tweets around about how people can help or important topics.  But I rarely will write a blog post, even write code, for an internet movement; not because I don't care, but because its a fast changing place and its hard to tell what will really stick around the Internet.  I believe in this effort: a distributed network of websites that can all speak out at once.  (The main thing I worry about is how often it gets used; you can't call on Batman every day)
