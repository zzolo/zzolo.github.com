There are times when the repeat button becomes a friend  
that I devote myself to. Some moments, I can  
not change the station fast enough, searching...  
searching for movement in satellite images  
of the block where my boat floats.

Your hair waves of grains, a portrait  
of a field and a wind that conflates  
to hide that focused ocean of lenses  
staring right to me. But more I am quenched  
by your every-move anecdotes.

I am glad today is your birthday.  
You were born and I am grateful  
for that. Each day you are the same  
sun-flaring, midnight marauding station.  
May your day be your image grown.
