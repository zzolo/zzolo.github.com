I have been skeptical of the radio for quite some time. I find most stations devoid of variety and soul. There are some various college stations I have heard that sometimes won't adhere to some strict line up of corporate music. Still, who am I to judge.

Living in Minneapolis, I have come across [The Current](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/ "MPR: The Current") which is a subsidary of [MPR](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/ "Minnesota Public Radio"). It is commercial free and full of variety; one cannot go wrong with this.

Further still, a new friend, Andi has shown me the light known as [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/ "Pandora"). This is an ad-free site that with the help of [Flash](http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/ "Macromedia Flash") creates a great interface to create your own radio station. You enter in an artist or song and it creates a playlist that is full of similar songs. The technology behind determining similarity between songs is something known as [The Music Genome Project](http://www.pandora.com/mgp.shtml "The Music Genome Project"). It seems to be quite amazing and I will have to find out more info on it. So, if you just don't know what to listen to, give it a try.
