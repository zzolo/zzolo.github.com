Inspired by [Textmas](https://github.com/emilyville/textmas) I made [Lumière](http://lumiere.meteor.com/) this year.  It's a string of addressable LED lights that can be updated through a Meteor-powered website or via SMS (text messaging).  See it in action below:

I learned a lot about electricity even though there is not much to hooking up the Raspberry Pi and the LED lights.  I also made everything [open source with full instructions up on Github](https://github.com/zzolo/lumiere).

For archival purposes, here is the screenshot of the [website](http://lumiere.meteor.com/).
