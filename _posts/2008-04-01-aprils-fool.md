So brave, she stopped me in my everyday  
to the tune of a common place; difficult,  
it is to see the courage on this side.

One step does not force the next; each step  
equals the part of the sum of the moment  
we keep crossing paths, walking in circles.

My gratitude for her bravery. My apologies  
for not taking the next step, at least  
not yet. The future is everywhere we look.
