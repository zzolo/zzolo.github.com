It's been a long time since I have put content up on this site (not to say that I have ever been consistent).  But, in my defense, I have been busy.  I got a wonderful job at the Chicago Technology Cooperative and since work at home which requires adjustment.  I am also looking at moving back to Portland, OR.

But, more importantly, I have been re-developing this site.  I am going to focus it more towards a location-based blog.  I had a good prototype done in Drupal 5, but then realized that I am a Drupal Developer and should be ridiculed if I did not build the site in Drupal 6.  I also made the the decision to build the site the correct way, which means I had to build some new modules.  I just released the [GMap Field](http://drupal.org/project/gmapfield) module.  It is still in development, but I hope it will benefit the community as it will my site.  I also have a Views Plugin that I am writing.  Once these things are done, I should be able to put together my new site with relative (and only stylistic) ease.

I'd give you a time-line, but there never seems to be enough time.  Let's aim for soon.
