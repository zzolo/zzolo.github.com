Today is June 21, 2006, the [Summer Solstice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Solstice "Summer Solstice"). This is the [longest day of the year](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/SummerSolstice.html "Wolfram Science Summer Solstice"). See how it all works [here](http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html "EarthScience.net | Earth-Sun Geometry").

Unfortunately I have that freelance [Web Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development "Wikipedia | Web Development") work to do. It keeps getting in the way of my [summer fun](http://www.agsfb.com/ "All Girl Summer Fun Band"). The sky is so invigorating, but I am stuck in front of this computer by my [own devices](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=leave%20to%20someone's%20own%20devices "My Own Devices"). The day is so long, but the computer is the only company I will keep. I'll have to celebrate [tomorrow!](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/parties.asp "All Tomorrow's Parties") You want to come along?
