When you see or hear this word, some might think of it as a really bad, corporate buzz word. Well, you wouldn't be wrong. Fortunately, it is also a wonderful open-source, cross-platform product that lets you share a keyboard and mouse across multiple computers. Like in my case, I have a laptop that I use right next to my desktop. Well instead of switching keyboards and mice, all you have to do is move the mouse off the screen. It works much like having multiple monitors on the same computer, but they're different computers! I heard a lot about it from friends and co-workers and I kind of just blew it off. But really, [Synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/ "Synergy") is such an amazing product.

Did I mention [Synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/ "Synergy") is [free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Wikipedia: Free Software"), [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Wikipedia: Open Source"), [Cross-Platform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_platform "Wikipedia: Cross-Platform"), and it allows for [copy and paste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_paste "Wikipedia: copy paste")!
