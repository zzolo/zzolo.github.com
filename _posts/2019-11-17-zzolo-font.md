Unsure if it will come in handy, and may one day be my demise as it only helps to impersonate me, but I couldn't resist making a [font from my own hand-writing](https://github.com/zzolo/zzolo-font).  [Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en/) made it pretty easy.  It would be great to create a bold version, or a mono-spaced version for coding, but that's probably not in the schedule any time soon.

I've added an easter egg that will make any page switch to the handwritten font.  Enjoy.
