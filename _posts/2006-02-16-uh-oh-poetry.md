You either love or hate it. Or maybe you just like Emily Dickenson. I love it, and it may be one of the only artistic things I can do. So, I have added a new section called [Writings](/en/writing/ "Writings"). It contains a few subsections at the moment: Poetry, Journal, and Others' Writings. It is still in development right now so there's only one poem up. Please keep in mind that the things I post are what I think are good relative to my ability. Now this may mean to you that I am horrible at this and should stop because I am making the world a worse place. On the other hand I have written a whole lot of extremely bad poetry. A whole lot.
