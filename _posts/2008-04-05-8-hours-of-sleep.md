This is [8 Hours of Sleep](http://www.againstme.net/am.php/lyrics/details/8_full_hours_of_sleep/ "Lyrics for 8 Hours of Sleep") by [Against Me!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Me! "Wikipedia: Against Me!") on the album [Reinventing Axl Rose](http://www.noidearecords.com/bands/releases/againstme_axl.php "Reinventing Axl Rose on No Idea Records").

Against Me! is a band that inspired my love for punk rock again. Specifically with this album a few years ago. There is so much honesty in it. 

This song, though depressing, helps put things in perspective. I am very lucky for what I have, for the fact that I have a bed to sleep in, for the fact that I have friends and love in my life, for the fact that I am still breathing and do not have to fear death so pervasively. Still all these thoughts make me wonder why I don't have the comfort of certain love, that there is a splitting of such special, simple love. It makes me wonder why I have to experience loss and dishonesty at all. I wonder why my heart breaks.
