I have the great honor of attending [DrupalCon Copenhagen](http://cph2010.drupal.org/) in a couple weeks, via a [scholarship](http://cph2010.drupal.org/news/scholarships) again!  I am still mad for missing DrupalCon San Francisco a few months ago due to a stupid volcano.  Like in SF, there is a [Core Developer Summit](http://cph2010.drupal.org/news/core-developer-summit), and like [before](http://zzolo.org/thoughts/block-instances) I have put together a basic set of slides to address a simple, but important topic: **The unwieldy issues with up to 400+ comments**.  Embedded presentation below:
