[Jake](http://www.spinink.net "SpinInk") tossed over this link to [George Nava's XUL Apps](http://www.georgenava.com/applauncher.php "George Nava's XUL Apps"). It's a plethora of simple online applications, in case, like in Windows, you do not have a Mail or Calendar application. Or if you just want to play some Video Poker.

These applications use a technology called [XUL](http://www.xulplanet.com/ "XUL") which translates to [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/ "XML") User Interface Language. XUL is specific to [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org "Mozilla") browsers. Basically, XUL is a coding library that allows you to "create rich, sophisticated cross-platform web applications easily."

Also, [George Nava](http://www.georgenava.com/ "George Nava") seems to be a pretty busy and intelligent person. The rest of his site is filled with neat things you should check out.
