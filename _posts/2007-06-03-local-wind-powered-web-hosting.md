There are a lot of [web-hosting companies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting "Wikipedia | Web Hosting Service") out there. Right now I go through [SpinInk](http://spinink.com/ "SpinInk Web Hosting") who is backed by [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost"). They are great and I am really happy with my service.

But I stumbled upon a [local (Minneapolis, MN), wind-powered web host](http://www.sundaysenergy.com/web/hosting "Sundays Energy Web Hosting"). Granted, I do not know anything about their service, and I think their prices are a bit high, but the idea is great. If I was not going for cheap with my hosting, I would consider them for sure.
