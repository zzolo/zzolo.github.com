I have been playing [F.E.A.R.](http://www.whatisfear.com/us/ "F.E.A.R.") the past couple days. An amazing game. It lacks in some areas like storyline and exotic environment. But it makes it up with an amazing physics engine and just a spectualr graphic experience. Its like a bowl full of Lucky Charms for your eyes. It has the most extensive graphics and performance options I have ever seen, as well as a simulation to test your FPS. And maybe I am easily scared but it definitely keeps me looking behind my back. The way they kind of slide in moving "ghosts" is really something.

A great game, maybe not to keep you reading the next page, but just to see what chain reaction of explosions is around the bend. Here are some good screenshots from [IGN](http://media.pc.ign.com/media/681/681912/imgs_1.html "F.E.A.R. screenshots").
