noticed this because it contains the front-man from [Appleseed Cast](http://www.theappleseedcast.com/ "Appleseed Cast"), Christopher Crisci. They're awesome but not what I need at this junction in my life. [Old Canes](http://www.oldcanes.com/ "Old Canes") also contains a member of [Casket Lottery](http://www.myspace.com/thecasketlottery "Casket Lottery"), which also doesn't provide the solace I am looking for. But together with a multiple of other artists, [Old Canes](http://www.oldcanes.com/ "Old Canes") makes me want to put [Two Gallants](http://www.twogallants.com/ "Two Gallants") down for a hot minute.

[Early Morning Hymns (listen here)](http://www.earlymorninghymns.com/ "Early Morning Hymns"), their debut album, is a foot-stomping, hand-clapping, rock-um-sock-um of an amazing time. Here is a [review](http://www.graynoise.net/index.php?id=20,104,0,0,1,0 "Early Morning Hymns Review") from [Gray Noise](http://www.graynoise.net/ "Gray Noise") that is funny as hell.
