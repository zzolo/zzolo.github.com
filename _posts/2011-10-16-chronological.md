Satellite imagery is pretty easily available these days.  For me, these images provide the same sort of nostalgia as photographs can.  So, given that I am currently thinking about where I want to be, and I couldn't stop listening to this one Astronautalis song, I made this [simple fly through of my life and where I have lived](http://maps.zzolo.org/chronological/).

It utilizes [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/), [Bing's map API](http://www.microsoft.com/maps/developers/web.aspx), and some [HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/) audio.
