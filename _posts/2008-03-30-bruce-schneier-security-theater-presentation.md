On Thursday, I went to the [Weisman Art Museum](http://www.weisman.umn.edu/ "Weisman Art Museum") at the [University of Minnesota](http://umn.edu "University of Minnesota") to see [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/ "Bruce Schneier") entitled _Security Theater_ as part of the [Paul Shambroom: Picturing Power](http://www.weisman.umn.edu/exhibits/Shambroom/ "Paul Shambroom: Picturing Power") exhibit that is at the Weisman until April 20, 2008.

> In this program, Bruce Schneier helps separate "security theater", or a fictive performance of safety and prevention, from its actual and effective workings.

My context of Bruce is mostly computer or technology related security.  The topics he addressed were not focused on computer, national, or even personal security.  This lecture focused more on the psychology of security and his _Feeling-Model-Reality_ view of security in society.

### Security Theater Presentation

The presentation started with a distinction between the _Feeling_ of security as being separate from the _Reality_ of security.  The goal of this model is to bring both these things together.  As a [Venn Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram "Wikipedia: Venn Diagram"), these two areas would overlap as much as possible.

Bruce also explained that the risks we take, what amount of security we will give up, is a trade-off, in the economical sense.  There are many factors in this trade-off.  But we usually will take the _Feeling_ of security over the _Reality_ of security.

Relating the feeling versus the _Reality_, Bruce stated, "if it's news, it's probably now worth worrying about."  This refers to the fact that news is sensational and is meant to be the extraordinary.  So, if someone is murdered, no matter how often it happens, and it's on the news, its still an exceptional event.  We need to be concerned for the things that are not on the news, the things that have become everyday and desensitized.  I really liked this idea.

Security Theater then refers to the idea that an agency is attempting to create the _Feeling_ of security regardless of the _Reality_ of security.  His example was after September 11, 2002, there were military personnel in airports with big guns, but these guns were not loaded.  The government created a _Feeling_ of security and not necessarily a _Reality_ of security.  This is not an inherently bad thing.  A _Feeling_ of security is important.

Talking about airport security led to the idea that people making decisions, specifically politicians are obligated to _do something_ especially in the case of security.  _Doing something_, whether helpful or not ensures that certain kinds of blame cannot be put onto that person or agency.  For instance, with airport security, each threat that has occurred has reacted a new security measure.  Specifically, we have to take off our shoes at security points.  We are not actually any safer because of it; but if for some reason, another person hides explosives in their shoes, the TSA cannot be blamed because they "did something".  People are not necessarily forgiving for these sort of situations, so _doing something_ is often more important that solving an issue intelligently and deliberately.

So, how do the _Feeling_ and _Reality_ relate?  This is where Bruce brought in another entity in the diagram: the _Model_.  The _Model_ is our personal view of how security works; it is our perception.  Our _Model_s are very often not the _Reality_.  Still, the _Model_ is very much influenced by both _Feeling_ and _Reality_.  Again, the goal is to have the three areas to overlap.

A security issue like airport security has many interested parties.  Unfortunately most of these parties have specific agendas.  These agenda push to create a _Model_ that is best fitting for that party.  Usually, the forces that drive these agendas are market or economical forces.

The _Model_ should converge with _Reality_.  The idea of expertise is extremely important for this to happen.  Our society is much too complex to not have experts.  Experts are detrimental for creating a _Model_ that is closest to _Reality_.

There was a time at the end for questions.  I am very interested in voting,  and Bruce has done a number of [writing and research on Voting Systems](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=8ff&amp;q=bruce+schneier+voting&amp;btnG=Search "Google Search: Bruce Schneier Voting"), so I asked him if he would apply his presentation to [voting systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system " Wikipedia: Voting Systems").  His main point in answering the question, and one I can agree with, was that no matter the technology, a society or constituency cannot feel like it's voting system is flawed.  The _Feeling_ of security is extremely important in this system.

### Conclusion

I was really impressed with this presentation.  Granted, I already had a lot of respect for Bruce.  Also, my co-workers got him to sign a couple hubs.  There are pictures at the top of this post.
