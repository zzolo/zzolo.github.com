Valentine's Day, I think is very much overrated, but I am not cliche enough to say I hate it. It's a good idea but has become too pink, commercialized, and just about romantic love. It should celebrate our love for everyone, and we shouldn't need a single day.

Luckily, there is art to mutilate perspectives on life. There was a Valentine's Day Card contest for [MCAD](http://www.mcad.edu/ "MCAD") students. They came through with flying colors. I have posted them on [My Gallery](http://www.alanpalazzolo.com/gallery/v/2006/valentines/ "MCAD Students' Valentine's Day Cards"). You can send one as an e-card from the [MCAD Story](http://intranet.mcad.edu/modules/news/view_news.php?story_id=935 "MCAD Valentine's Day Story").
