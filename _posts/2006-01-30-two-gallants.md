Life is an endless ride it seems. Even the brightest flames go out without fuel. And though I just want to get off this crazy thing for just a moment to collect myself, the train follows the tracks even through the darkness. I miss her so much.

So, when there is no light and each step I have to check twice, the songs of others help guide my way. I stumbled across this band, [Two Gallants](http://www.twogallants.com "Two Gallants"), a couple weeks ago. It's powerful stuff. The newer album, "What the Toll Tells" has help given me back a voice and provided a beat to march forward to. Thank you.

Since my words are not good enough, here is a [Pitchfork Review](http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/t/two-gallants/throes.shtml "PitchFork: Two Gallants Review") of their older album, "The Throes".
