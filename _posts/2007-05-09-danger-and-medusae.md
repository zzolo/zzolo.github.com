My main desktop computer is cased in [acrylic](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811148012 "xPCGear Arylic Case"). I had never owned an acrylic case or even seen one in person before, so I figured I would try it out. I even went as far as buying a [power supply](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817170011 "Logisys Acrylic Power Supply") cased in acrylic. I mean, if I can see the power supply, I might as well be able to see through it.

### Danger
Well, the problem that plagued the acrylic power supply and case was that the [fans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fan "Wikipedia | Computer Fan") on the [power supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_power_supply "Wikipedia | Computer Power Supply") contained [LEDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led "Wikipedia: Light Emitting Diode") that only turned off with the computer. So, after looking into the power supply (because I could), I determined that the fans were just regular computer fans with three-pin connectors. These would be easy to replace.

The first thing to remember is that the power supply contains huge, dangerous [capacitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitors "Wikipedia | Capacitors"). These capacitors, if touched, can be quite painful or lethal. I left the computer unplugged for over 12 hours and kept the power button down for over ten seconds while it was off. Without any kind of measuring device, I did the best I could. Removing the fans was straight-forward and took about twenty minutes with cleaning.

### Medusae
I named this computer Medusae, because it resembles [this form of cnidarian (jellyfish)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa_%28biology%29 "Wikipedia | Medusa (Biology)").

After finishing up with the improvements to the power supply, I decided to cleanup Medusae a bit. I had gotten a couple [UV cold cathode lights](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16800888039 "Logisys 4inch UV Cold Cathode Kit"). One of the major downsides of the acrylic case is that dirt, dust, and scratches show up a lot easier. So, I got in there deep and got it spotless. I also got the cables managed well.

This took me about three hours, making the project a much longer one than expected. When I had first put together Medusae, I tried to get some good pictures of the process and the end product, but to no avail. I was determined to get some good ones this time, now that she looked her best. I used my [Panasonic Lumix](http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/digital_cameras/lumix.asp "Panasonic Lumix") and some makeshift solid stands, as I do not own a tripod, and shot away. I am quite pleased with how the pictures turned out. Here are some highlights:
