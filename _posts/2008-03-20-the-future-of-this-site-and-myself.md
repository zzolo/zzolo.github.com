I had updated this site to [Drupal 6](http://drupal.org/download), but did not realize that some fundamental modules, like [CCK](http://drupal.org/project/cck) and [Views](http://drupal.org/project/views), were not quite where they needed to be.  This is not to say that there is any sort of lacking on the developer's side.

The [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) project is really amazing, and I have come to love it and its community.  So, even though I got a little too excited, I also have in turn found the motivation to start to give back to such a wonderful community.  The desire was already there, but I guess I needed a push.  Yes, I am saying it here first; I am giving back.  There are many ways to [contribute](http://drupal.org/contribute) to Drupal.  I am not sure which path I will go down first, but I have got a couple ideas for some modules.

Also, I am rebuilding this site from the bottom up (again):

* I am abandoning [Gallery 2](http://gallery.menalto.com/), another wonderful open-source project.  This is not because of any fault of its own, but because I would like something a little more streamlined.  I don't need all the functionality that Gallery 2 comes with.  The space my images were taking up was getting a little ridiculous as well.  So, I apologize for anyone that had links to any of those gallery images.  I imagine any of the good ones will be back up in due time.
* I need to make a new Drupal theme, this one, [Barron](http://drupal.org/project/barron) is pretty awesome for now.
* I will be importing my old content as well.  I would like to rethink how I was making my map points
* I am allowing comments and using [reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/) to avoid spam.  So, please leave me some comments so I can make myself and this site better and more enjoyable for all.
