On **Saturday 2009 June 20**, the [Twin Cities Documentation Sprint](http://groups.drupal.org/node/21946) (that's the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul in Minnesota, USA) will happen from 10AM through 5PM CST being held at [Advantage Labs](http://www.advantagelabs.com/) with sponsorships from [fivefivefour](http://www.fivefivefour.com/) and [Gorton Studios](http://www.gortonstudios.com/).  This event was [crowd-sourced](http://zzolo.org/thoughts/drupal-and-drinking) at one of our meeting.

We are still figuring out what areas we can focus on, but we don't actually need a specific agenda.  If you have some documentation requests, please [leave a comment](http://groups.drupal.org/node/21946#comment-form).  There will also be some members in the #drupal-docs IRC channel as well.
