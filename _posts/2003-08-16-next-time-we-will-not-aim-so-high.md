Come two o’clock, the rain will  
pat down the roofs, cleansing  
our everydays woken with weighted  
hearts. The sun waits until  
the clouds form like circling  
vultures craving radiant rays.

Your eyes are true.

Those decadent days spent with antiques  
and flowers, where windows were bleak  
across my room, and we sucked the life  
from balloons. Still, this sentimental satellite  
orbits around my heart, even through this war.  
Take my hand, I won’t lay low here anymore.

Your eyes are new.

So, maybe you have become a statue,  
a monumental moment buzzing through  
the air, on heighted hilltop. There a sense  
of glory and grace so magnificent  
to shine for the lucky victims, bold  
to eyes. Still, I wish you would break this mold.

Your eyes are stone.

So when we go to bed, we dream like guns,  
flopping around like fire arms.  
I don’t know when, but a day’s gonna come,  
where my ears will hear this silent alarm,  
and I’ll know my expectations have been too high  
for such a simple, sacred, subtle girl to reply.
