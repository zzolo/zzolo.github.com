title: Ten Toes in the Sand
---

A while ago, I received a free domain name from Dreamhost, I believe.  I did not really have a need for one at the time, so it took me a minute to think of what to do with it.  Around the same time, I was having some difficult personal issues and was writing more poetry, mostly the bad, angry, depressed kind.  So, I thought I would start a personal, anonymous blog, **TenToesInTheSand.org**.

By being anonymous, I thought I could share my thoughts and be more honest, which I was.  But, I did not really keep up with it and just let the domain lapse.  I have imported some of the content into this site, and kept the rest to dig up again in many years.  Here are a few of the headers that were used throughout.

(The name comes from this [Aesop Rock song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASP3aZLPsb4).)
