Tonight I played MASH for the first time in at least ten years with my good friend Beth. MASH is a childhood fortune-telling game where the goal is to determine where and how the player will live when they grow up. You can learn more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH_%28game%29 "Wikipedia: MASH"). You can also play at [PlayMash.com](http://www.playmash.com/ "PlayMash.com") or [MashGame.com](http://www.mashgame.com/ "MashGame.com").

We kind of made up our own categories, but here is my future summed up in a few words:

- I will live in **Portland, OR**
- in a **castle**
- living with **[The Agent](http://raycamacho.com/ "The Agent is Ray")**
- taking care of **9 really cool cats**
- while always listening to **Jump in the Line** by Harry Belafonte
- drinking lots of **PBR**
- transporting myself via **bus**
- and supporting myself quite easily because I am an **independently wealthy stamp collector**
