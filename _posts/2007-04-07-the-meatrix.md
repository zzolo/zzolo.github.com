My friend Diana, pointed me to [The Meatrix](http://www.themeatrix.com/ "The Meatrix"). It's fun and will hopefully make you want to learn more about modern food production. Though it is kind of childish and simple, it is very accessible for everyone which is crucial for change. I also like how it uses [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/ "Adobe Flash") correctly, as a movie and not as a whole site or navigation. Though, they lose points for not having a volume control on their movie which is so uncool.

### My Views
I will try not to tell you how to live your life, but I will take this opportunity to share my personal views on the subject. I have recently become a [vegetarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism "Wikipedia | Vegetarianism") again. Before, I was vegetarian for a few years and about six months of that I was [Vegan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism "Wikipedia | Veganism"). I would like to embrace veganism in my life again because I think vegetarianism is half-assed, but I have also realized through the years that I cannot always change overnight.

I personally do not think that the consumption of animals for food or clothing is necessarily wrong. It can be argued whether humans are "naturally" herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores, but it seems to be that our bodies are adapted to eat meat. On the other hand, I do not believe that the consumption of diary is "natural".

The problem, I believe is with the current production of animals. Besides the fact that it is absurdly cruel to animals, it is so destructive to the environment as a whole. The numerous facts and statistics that support these claims can be found in the resources below. Personally, just driving through the [hog farming region of North Carolina](http://www.environmentaldefense.org/article.cfm?contentID=5078 "Hog Farming Region of North Carolina") you can smell the evidence. And it is not just animal waste that destroys our planet, it's the amount of resources that go into the production.

So, even if we could make changes so that all animals for consumption were treated well and that the production was more sustainable for the Earth, in the " [Global North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North "Wikipedia | Global North")", we still devour maore meat than is sustainable. It is similar to the energy crisis, even if we only use sustainable energy sources, we still use too much electricity.

I understand that this is a very limited view on this subject, but please watch [The Meatrix](http://www.themeatrix.com/ "The Meatrix") and read through some of the resources below. At least with knowledge you can make better decisions in your life.
