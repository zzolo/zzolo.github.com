title: New Site (again)
---

As a web developer/coder/architect/whatever I can't help care about and constantly change my "web presence", even if I don't make a lot of content.  This site (zzolo.org) has, or is currently in the process of being, moved and redeveloped from the ground up.

The new site runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted through [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  The previous site was run on [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and hosted at [VPS.net](http://vps.net/).  Here are the main reasons why I have made this shift.

* _Cost_.  Github Pages is a free service provided by Github.  I was not spending a lot of money with VPS.net, but that was through some discounts.  Running Drupal sites that can handle traffic spikes is not a cheap activity.
* _Complication_.  Jekyll is a very thin layer on top of plain HTML/CSS/JS; it has very little options and features.  Previously I had hoped and sometimes accomplished using my personal site(s) as places for experimentation where having a full server and platform made sense, but now I just want to make a small post and go.  Drupal is a complicated, and powerful, platform that I just don't need and haven't really used in some time.  I also don't have to worry about server administration.
* _Stability_.  With significantly less complication, the site is much more stable.
* _Security_.  The new site is essentially flat files and that means there is little to no security risks.  With Drupal I had to stay on top of security updates.
* _Skills_.  I no longer do much Drupal work and those skills are not as sharp as they once were.  On the flip side, I use Github everyday and code primarily with just HTML/CSS/JS.
* _Newness_.  It was time for a change (visually).

### A look back

I have had this website, zzolo.org (previously and redirected from alanpalazzolo.com) for about 10 years, and thought I have surprising little content to show for it, it has gone through many different iterations.  I have not been that great about taking screenshots for each version, but here are some that I do have and some various resources.

#### Flash (yep)

Let's start from as far back as we can and get the worst out of the way first.  That's right, I had a 3D Flash header back in the day.  This was right after I changed from an all-Flash website to a CSS one.  (You can right-click and hit Play to play it again)

<div>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" 
  data="/images/posts/zzold/aplogo.swf" 
  width="100%" height="300px">
  <param name="movie" value="/images/posts/zzold/aplogo.swf" />
  <param name="quality" value="high"/>
</object>
</div>

#### Photoshop skills

I have horrible Photoshop/GIMP skills, but I try.  I used images like these ones in my site:

#### Badges

Remember when badges were awesome.  Well, I do.  I even created one:

#### I was so artsy

Some various headers:

#### Recently

The most recent version (maybe version 7), I do have screenshots from.  The site had a homepage that was just a huge map, focusing on place.

Each image that was uploaded was automatically geocoded and put on the map.

I also tried to keep up with the books I was reading.

I made a very specific print style sheet for my CV/Resume so that I could simply print from the web page.  This has not carried over yet.

The _Explore_ page was a [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) display of content.

One year I tried to write a haiku and take a self portrait every day.  It only last a couple months.  This should make its way back onto the new site at some point.
