title: New Site (again)
---

As a web developer/coder/architect/whatever I can't help care about and constantly change my "web presence", even if I don't make a lot of content.  This site (zzolo.org) has, or is currently in the process of being, moved and redeveloped from the ground up.

The new site runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted through [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  The previous site was run on [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and hosted at [VPS.net](http://vps.net/).  Here are the main reasons why I have made this shift.

* _Cost_.  Github Pages is a free service provided by Github.  I was not spending a lot of money with VPS.net, but that was through some discounts.  Running Drupal sites that can handle traffic spikes is not a cheap activity.
* _Complication_.  Jekyll is a very thin layer on top of plain HTML/CSS/JS; it has very little options and features.  Previously I had hoped and sometimes accomplished using my personal site(s) as places for experimentation where having a full server and platform made sense, but now I just want to make a small post and go.  Drupal is a complicated, and powerful, platform that I just don't need and haven't really used in some time.  I also don't have to worry about server administration.
* _Stability_.  With significantly less complication, the site is much more stable.
* _Security_.  The new site is essentially flat files and that means there is little to no security risks.  With Drupal I had to stay on top of security updates.
* _Skills_.  I no longer do much Drupal work and those skills are not as sharp as they once were.  On the flip side, I use Github everyday and code primarily with just HTML/CSS/JS.
* _Newness_.  It was time for a change (visually).

I recently dug up content and old sites, so you can some samples of [previous versions of this site]({% post_url 2013-07-12-a-look-back %}).
