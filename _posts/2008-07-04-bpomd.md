The buttery papaya orchestrated morsels, so delicious,  
like the brilliant pink orchid meandering through the daylight  
when buzzards peruse the open marshlands diving  
for bioluminescent probiotic organic matter decaying,

But, probably operating on most divulgences,  
the best part of my day is you.
