The Third Annual RhuBarBeQue went off splendidly on May 10, 2008 at Fort Awesome (that's where I live).

The BhuBarBeQue is a celebration of the wonderful vegetable known as [Rhubarb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhubarb "Wikipedia: Rhubarb").  Rhubarb is a perennial that survives in the tundra known as Minnesota, and is one of the first edible things to come up in the spring.  So, the RhuBarBeQue celebrates the thawing of this Midwest place after such a long hibernation.

It was raining and cold, but we still had a great time.  Some of the dishes that were contributed to a full belly are the following (please keep in mind that all of these were delicious):

* The usual RhuBarBeQue Sauce
* Rhubarb Cream Cheese Wontons
* Rhubarb Curried Cauliflower
* Rhubarb Cobbler
* Rhubarb Salsa
* RhuJitos (Rhubarb Mojitos)
* Rhubarb Marinated Tofu
* Rhubarb Pilaf
* Rhubarb and Tempeh Bread Bowl with Chevre
* Rhubarb Wine
* Rhubarb Dream Bars
* Rhubarb Compote on Vanilla Ice Cream
* Rhubarb Bread
* Rhubarb Sticky Rice
