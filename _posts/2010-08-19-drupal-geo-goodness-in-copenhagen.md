In just a few short days, [DrupalCon Copenhagen 2010](http://cph2010.drupal.org/) will begin.  I am super excited, especially since I was really fortunate enough to get a [scholarship](http://cph2010.drupal.org/news/scholarships) from the [Drupal Association](http://association.drupal.org/).  I am still a bit weary of the possibility of being [stranded because of a volcano](http://twitter.com/zzolo/statuses/12245442220) again.

There is a lot happening in the Drupal world around geospatial-related technologies and putting a sense of place to data (I never know the right term to encompass all that).  And fortunately, there are a couple of geospatial related events going on at Copenhagen, and hopefully lots of ad hoc discussions in the hallway.  No matter your expertise, if you are interested, please come on out, and feel free to stop and ask questions (though I can't promise I have all the answers).

### Mapping in Drupal with OpenLayers ###

Myself and [Thomas Turnbull](https://drupal.org/user/125573) will be giving a presentation on [Mapping in Drupal with OpenLayers](http://cph2010.drupal.org/sessions/mapping-drupal-openlayers) which will focus on giving an overview of how the module works, alongside a live demo of the cool functionality that this module offers.  It will be focused for mostly people that have not used the module before, but given time will discuss some architecture as well.

You can even get a sneak peak at the [presentation on GitHub](http://github.com/zzolo/openlayers-presentation-dccph2010) (not finished yet).  You can also put together your own demo site with the [module, make, script, feature set extravaganza on GitHub](http://github.com/zzolo/ol_dccph2010_demo).

The presentation will be **25 August 2010 at 13:30 in the VPS.NET room** (right after Rasmus' crowd-sourced keynote).

### Drupal and Geo-Stuff BoF ###

I have also reserved a BoF space to discuss the [state of Drupal and geospatial things](http://cph2010.drupal.org/sessions/drupal-and-geographic-technologies).  It'll be a very open discussion, but ideally we will focus on the following:

* The state of the Drupal GeoCMS.
* What is missing?
* What the future holds?
* How do we get there?

The BoF will be **25 August 2010 at 16:00 in the BoF Space 4**.
