title: Aurora Shanty

The Art Shanties are an amazing and very Minnesotan event where artists are invited to create unique shanties or experiences on a frozen lake in February in Minnesota.  It could loosely be described as a very mini Burning Man except on a frozen lake and without the pretension.  This year, myself and some friends were accepted to make the [Aurora Shanty](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/706726178/the-aurora-shanty) &mdash; the northern lights inside an ice shanty.

Sam and Caitlin helped out a lot with the Kickstarter video and some other visual materials.  Also, we had a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/706726178/the-aurora-shanty) since the electronics cost a bit more than our stipend would cover.

I learned a lot about building a structure like a shanty, solar power, electricity, Processing, Fadecandy, and of course lots of LEDs.  And I continued to experience so much inconsistency with a Raspberry Pi.  [Code](https://github.com/zzolo/aurora-shanty) is up on Github as usual, though it's not that well documented since the project took a lot of time and energy.
