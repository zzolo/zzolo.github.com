I should be working, but I am just not concentrating. Most music reviews start off something like this: "Everyonce in a while a band will come along..." like some bad movie trailer, or something like "There are so many bands that... but...". It is too hard to find bad music reviews.

[McLusky](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky") is brutally honest, a wonderful quality. If you want something that will offend you, make you cringe, and make you want to move, then give McLusky a whirl. I have only listened to them for a couple years (as thanks to Joel and Chris), but they have been around for about 6 years from what I understand. They broke up some time last year which is a shame. What's a shame is putting out a best of album. I am not a big fan of these unless it contains things that are no longer released. This new release, McLuskyism (released after they broke up, nonetheless, so I wonder who gets the profits) is a good place to start for new-comers. As I am not impressed, it's a nice reminder of great songs.

Even with such great tunes, [McLusky](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky") can sell me on simply album titles like ["the difference between me and you is that i'm not on fire"](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky"), ["my pain and sadness is more sad and painful than yours"](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky"), as well as ["she will only bring you happiness"](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky"). And I especially am fond of one of their best songs called ["alan is a cowboy killer"](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky").

Here is a [Pitchrofk Media Review](http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/m/mclusky/difference-between-me-and-you.shtml "Pitchrofk Media Review") of ["the difference between me and you is that i'm not on fire"](http://www.mclusky.net/ "McLusky").
