This site got a new face-lift.  The basic color scheme is the same, but I decided to use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blueprint" title=" Blueprint Drupal Theme">Blueprint theme</a> as a base.  I will be the first to say that I am not very good at design, but I am always open to <a href="/contact" title="Tell me what you think">criticism</a>.  I am also am never satisfied with the sate of my site, so it always end up in a state of flux.  It's good experience for me, but ends up being inconsistent to the user (which is you), so I am sorry.

### Haikus and Portraits ###

I have failed!  It's true.  But I am not out of the game yet.  I have pretty much kept up with my pictures, but the haikus have fallen behind.  Also, finding the time to post them seems to be limited.  I know you are disappointed, but I will get them up as soon as possible.

### Images ###

Most of the site images are broken.  I will fix them real soon.
