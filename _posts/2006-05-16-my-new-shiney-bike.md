I got a new bike a few days ago! It is a [Bianchi](http://www.bianchiusa.com/ "Bianchi") [Boardwalk](http://www.bianchiusa.com/05_boardwalk.html "Bianchi Boardwalk"). Its a hybrid. Its great! Now i can feel righteous over those suckers driving cars. I just wish it would stop raining.

I got a good amount of riding in today. It runs so smooth and its so light. It's a whole new world. And I do not have to waste all that time on the bus. Now I just have to get used to this city via bike.
