I have come to realize that my News section is not really news at all. I am not sure what would qualify "news" in the life of Alan Palazzolo. But it is what it is.

Anyway, I saw a really great movie this weekend called [Look Both Ways](http://www.lookbothways.com.au/ "Look Both Ways"). I saw it as a part of the [Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Film Festival](http://www.mspfilmfest.org/ "Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Film Festival"). Look Both Ways is an Australian movie with its main theme about death. In turn it explores other themes like life and love. It was a pretty "heavy" movie, for lack of a better adjective. Check it out if you get the chance.
