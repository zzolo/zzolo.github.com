This is **Deserted** by [Milemarker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milemarker_%28band%29 "Wikipedia: Milemarker") from [Ominosity](http://www.milemarker.org/ "Milemarker Official Site, which is mostly an promotion for Ominosity").

I love this song; the end really gets in my soul. And by no means, is it the best of Milemarker. Milemarker has been such an underrated band in my opinion. They are aggressive, in every aspects of the word. They have a wide range of sound, and really want to push norms in their lyrics, music, and performances. One show I saw of them, Roby set her arms on fire. They like fire.

So, in doing research about MileMarker, in hope that what I write is accurate, I found that they are still together and about to tour Europe. That's really exciting. Unfortunately, it seems the most up to date information is on their [MySpace Page](http://www.myspace.com/ominosity "Milemarker MySpace Page").

[Roy Christopher](http://roychristopher.com/ "Roy Christopher") did a really great [interview with Milemarker](http://roychristopher.com/milemarker-the-only-band-that-matters "Interview with Milemarker by Roy Chrisopher") from 2001.
