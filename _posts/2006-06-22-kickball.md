[KickBall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickball "Wikipedia | Kickball") season is upon us. Some friends have started a team and I got picked (not last)! It should be a great time. I think we can drink while we play and that only spells debaucherous fun. So, we are still deciding on a name. [Here](http://www.musakickball.com/MUSA%20Minnesota/Division%20Schedules-Minnesota.htm#Monday "Other Teams Names") are the other names for the teams in the league (a lot of Balls references, who would have thought). In most cases, coming up with possible Team Names can be a huge mess. But not this team. Check out the list below of possible names. Hilarious!
