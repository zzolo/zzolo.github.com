brave jasmine breeze  
summer-stained eyes focus toward  
vague yellow-haired woman

  
blue and brown exchanged  
mac and cheese tumbled down the stairs  
passing, swapping smiles

  
shy boy makes gallant stir  
brazen beauty reciprocates  
budding steps

  
fourth dimension freeze frame  
hands without plat and compass  
smiles, talk teeming

  
touch, sleeping  
like babies; your small mouth  
gigantic, allowing meaning

  
when the computer  
stares me down, i smile and see  
you come down those stairs

  
there is anger  
in brilliant eyes  
only difference allows meaning
