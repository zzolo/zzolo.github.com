I have been meaning to write this post for a while, but it seems to slip my mind (which it shouldn't). About a month ago, I came across this wonderful internet resource (website) called [GlobalIssues.org](http://www.globalissues.org/ "GlobalIssues.org"). It is just that: a website focused on providing a information base for all sorts of global issues. It is not a news site, so much as a gathering of resources and summaries of issues that should be addressed. If you should want a beggining point on a number of Global Issues, such as [Causes of Poverty](http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty.asp "Causes of Poverty"), [Fair Trade](http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/FairTrade.asp "Fair Trade"), and so much more, then it is a really great place to start some research.

[GlobalIssues.org](http://www.globalissues.org/ "GlobalIssues.org"), besides for the fact that it is done with ASP, is a really well laid out site full of so much information, maintained by a really nice guy, [Anup Shah](http://www.globalissues.org/about/who/ "Anup Shah") all by his lonesome. I know he is nice because I have had the pleasure of having some minor contact with him. Check it out.
