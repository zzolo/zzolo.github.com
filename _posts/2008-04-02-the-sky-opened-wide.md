This is [The Sky Opened Wide Like The Tide (Lucky Dragons Newage Powermix)](http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858543852 "(Lyrics at Song Meaning) The Sky Opened Wide Like The Tide (Lucky Dragons Newage Powermix)") by [The Blow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blow "Wikipedia: The Blow") on the album [Poor Aim: Love Songs](http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/1827 "Poor Aim: Love Songs (a Dusted Review)").

I have had this song in my head for a couple days. It is probably because I have been listening to it for a couple days straight. I keep hitting the back button after its done. It's like the song just is never finished. I also am putting this up for Sharon, since I talked with her for the first time in a while tonight. I think she'll like it. I think you will too.
