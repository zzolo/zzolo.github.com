Walked in on a sea of buckets and charades  
that swept us out to a sailing sea, spiders  
with two hands, and sun-spewing, pizza-baking  
eyes. The whispering wind posed brighter,  
breathing walls, but the swirly centipede swarm  
scurries in the night--our hands toil.  
We have been witnessed, you have been warned  
that if all this ferocious fear, bug-black soil,  
exploding dogs, emancipating drives, cascading  
lives, and bottomless-tea aggregates, writhes  
into a single brilliant point, it is your radiating  
smile. It is no other--it reflects in my arduous eyes  
that the karoke is only the start of, and the end  
is a horizon we will find together, my dearest friend.
