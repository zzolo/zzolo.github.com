title: The Future of this Site and Myself

I had updated this site to <a href="http://drupal.org/download" title="Drupal 6">Drupal 6</a>, but did not realize that some fundamental modules, like <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck" title="Drupal CCK Module">CCK</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views" title="Drupal Views Module">Views</a>, were not quite where they needed to be.  This is not to say that there is any sort of lacking on the developer's side.

The <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal">Drupal</a> project is really amazing, and I have come to love it and its community.  So, even though I got a little too excited, I also have in turn found the motivation to start to give back to such a wonderful community.  The desire was already there, but I guess I needed a push.  Yes, I am saying it here first; I am giving back.  There are many ways to <a href="http://drupal.org/contribute" title="Contribute to Drupal">contribute</a> to Drupal.  I am not sure which path I will go down first, but I have got a couple ideas for some modules.

Also, I am rebuilding this site from the bottom up (again):

<ul><li>I am abandoning <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" title="Gallery 2">Gallery 2</a>, another wonderful open-source project.  This is not because of any fault of its own, but because I would like something a little more streamlined.  I don't need all the functionality that Gallery 2 comes with.  The space my images were taking up was getting a little ridiculous as well.  So, I apologize for anyone that had links to any of those gallery images.  I imagine any of the good ones will be back up in due time.</li>
<li>I need to make a new Drupal theme, this one, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/barron" title="Barron">Barron</a> is pretty awesome for now.</li>
<li>I will be importing my old content as well.  I would like to rethink how I was making my map points</li>
<li>I am allowing comments and using <a href="http://recaptcha.net/" title="reCAPTCHA">reCAPTCHA</a> to avoid spam.  So, please leave me some comments so I can make myself and this site better and more enjoyable for all.</li>
</ul>
