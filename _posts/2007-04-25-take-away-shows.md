I am not really sure how I made it to [Take Away Shows](http://www.takeawayshows.com/ "Take Away Shows"), but the [internet](http://xkcd.com/c195.html "XKCD's Map of the Internet") is a strange place that leads to many doors. Well, this door proved to have all types of shiny [booty](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=411 "Dinosaur Comics and Booty") behind it.

"You meet a band. You take them outside, in the streets, and ask them to play there, shoot the movie in one unique shot, whatever happens. Those are the Take-Away Shows, the weekly Video podcast from french weblog La Blogothèque." - [About](http://www.blogotheque.net/cae_about_en.php3 "About Cast Away Shows")

Take Away Shows is actually the English version of the French site, [Les Concerts a Emporter](http://www.concertaemporter.com/ "Les Concerts a Emporter"), which are both part of the [weblog](http://www.xkcd.com/c124.html "XKCD's Blogofractal"), [La Blogotheque](http://www.blogotheque.net/ " La Blogotheque"). They film a lot of great bands in a unique environment without editing, and from the ones I have watched so far, it turns out beautiful.

Their video seems to be stored on [DailyMotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/ "DailyMotion"), a video and social networking site. Here is their [La Blogotheque DailyMotion Profile](http://www.dailymotion.com/lablogotheque "Blogotheque Dailymotion Profile"). [Vincent Moon](http://www.vincentmoon.com/ "Vincent Moon") directs the videos. They offer an HD version of their videos when they first get posted, then just regular videocast after that.

Here is a list of [All Take Away Concerts](http://www.blogotheque.net/cae_tous_les_concerts_en.php3 "All Take Away Shows"). [This new one](http://www.blogotheque.net/article.php3?id_article=2976 "Andrew Bird on Take Away Shows") is [Andrew Bird](http://andrewbird.net/ "Andrew Bird") performing as he walks through the streets of Paris.

[Daytrotter](http://www.daytrotter.com/ "Daytrotter") is a partner of Take Away Shows that offers free audio downloads of great musicians. Another great site.

"These fine people – as they’re traveling through America’s heartland – take two hours out of their travels between shows to stop in for a Daytrotter Session at Futureappletree Studio One in downtown Rock Island, IL" - [About](http://www.daytrotter.com/about "About Day Trotter")

Amazing!
