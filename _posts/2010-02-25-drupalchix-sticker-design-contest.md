Spread the word; [Chach Sikes](http://drupal.org/user/50674) and [Erika Stenrick](http://drupal.org/user/183570) who work with [Gorton Studios](http://gortonstudios.com/), have just announced a [DrupaChix Sticker Design Contest](http://groups.drupal.org/node/52728) for [DrupalCon San Francisco](http://sf2010.drupal.org/) (sponsored by [Gorton Studios](http://gortonstudios.com/)).  This is a great opportunity for anyone to show off their design skills, and, more importantly, help support women in our Drupal community.

In case you aren't in the know, [DrupalChix](http://groups.drupal.org/drupalchix) is an awesome group dedicated to supporting existing women in the Drupal community as well as working towards getting more women involved in Drupal.  Drupal has such a great community, but we could be so much better by getting more women (and other under-represented people) involved into Drupal.

The stickers will be made in mass quantity and distributed at DrupalCon San Francisco.  Designs are due in by **15 March 2009**, so act quick!  Post your entries to [this thread](http://groups.drupal.org/node/52728).  And for the non-designers, voting begins on **17 March 2010**.
