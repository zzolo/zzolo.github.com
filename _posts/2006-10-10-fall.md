Days seamlessly shrink and hasten bedtime  
as notorious night ripens the autumn moon.  
The sun becomes Southern, a sprightly  
belle spoken in a draw. With dashing moves,  
the winter approaches a reluctant summer.

Light compiled no longer, the green subsides  
into an ocean of transition. The trees tomb  
facilitates its own hibernation and like  
fireworks, the leaves explode, a moment  
of fire before the furnace-embracing winter.

Production ceases, the factory decays, a blight  
annually announced by each step. The leaf stumbles  
to the ground, a passing of weightlessness glides  
through the air. The freedom of change roams  
before the first frost bites this photographer.

I like the way you walk fast as if there might  
be warmth in that brisk morning â€“ a wakeful-  
ness prepared to pounce. So, we gather a pile  
of organic thoughts one at a time. If we should  
jump into that accumulation, we should fall together.
