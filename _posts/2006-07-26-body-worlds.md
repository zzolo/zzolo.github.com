The [Body Worlds](http://www.bodyworlds.com/ "Body Worlds by Gunther von Hagens") exhibit by [Gunther von Hagens](http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/gunther_von_hagens.html "About Gunther von Hagens") is at the [Science Museum of Minnesota](http://www.smm.org/ "Science Museum of Minnesota") until Labor Day. Body Worlds is an amazing view of the human (and animal) anatomy. Von Hagens uses a process called [Plastination](http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/plastination.html "Plastination") to turn human body parts from donated specimens into plastic. It is really quite amazing. If Body Worlds is [coming to your town](http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/current_exhibitions.html "Body World Schedule"), go see it.

The exhibit I saw is very extensive. It took a dozen of us a range from 1.5 and 3 hours to go through. Some people may not be comfortable with how graphic it is. But those people should brave their wussy storm. I think it is a great perspective for everyone to see our anatomy so vivid. A lot of times, we get caught up in our minds and society and forget that we are just flesh and bone (very compicated flesh and bones).
