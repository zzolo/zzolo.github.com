[Mollom](http://mollom.com/ "Mollom") is a spam deterrent and overall content moderation system by [Dries Buytaert](http://buytaert.net/ "Dries Buytaert"), the creator of [Drupal](http://drupal.org "Drupal"), and [Benjamin Schrauwen](http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=4532553 "Benjamin Schrauwen").  It is similar to [Akismet](http://akismet.com/ "Akismet").  There is a good [post about Mollom](http://drupal.org/node/241211 "Mollom, my content monitoring startup") by Dries on [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org "Drupal").

I am trying out the Public Beta.  Unfortunately I don't get many or any comments (hint hint) in order to do some good testing.  I have good faith in the mind of Dries and think it will become a good option for content moderation (spam killing).  I will keep this updated as I learn more.

Of course there is a [Drupal Module](http://drupal.org/project/mollom "Mollom Drupal Module at Drupal.org") for it.  There is also a [Java Library](http://mollom.com/files/mollom-java.zip "Mollom Java Library") to interface with the [API](http://mollom.com/api "Mollom API").
